  Building systems that scale.
</div>

## Engineering Focus
- High-performance distributed systems
- Low-level optimizations
- System architecture
- Performance profiling

## Technical Approach
```typescript
interface Engineering {
focus: 'performance' | 'reliability' | 'scalability'
approach: 'first principles' | 'data driven'
standards: 'high' | 'higher' | 'highest'
}
```


## Recent Deep Dives
- Memory leak detection in production
- Cache invalidation strategies
- Thread pool optimization
- Network protocol design
